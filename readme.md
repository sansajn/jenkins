# About

The repository serves as a description to run Jenkins in docker container with aim to build C++ projects in a docker container.

Custom Jenkins docker is build around [Official Jenkins Docker image](https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker/blob/master/README.md).

## Initial setup

To build Jenkins docker image run

```bash
make image
```

command. After that container can be run with

```bash
make start
```

command which will run jenkins docker as `jenkins_container` container, see result of `socker ps -a` command

```conosle
$ docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE             COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                      PORTS                                                                                      NAMES
4fc2d354c160   jenkins:1.0       "/usr/bin/tini -- /uâ€¦"   16 seconds ago   Up 15 seconds               0.0.0.0:8080->8080/tcp, :::8080->8080/tcp, 0.0.0.0:50000->50000/tcp, :::50000->50000/tcp   jenkins_container
```

After `make start` jenkins is available on `localhost:8000` address from the browser.

Jenkins logs can be shown by

```bash
docker logs jenkins_container
```

command e.g. to check first login token.

Jenkins generated content is stored in `jenkins_home` docker volume

```console
$ docker volume ls
DRIVER    VOLUME NAME
local     jenkins_home
```

so it is available also after `jenkins_container` container is removed (good for image updates).


## Sample C++ Jenkins job

Create *Multibranch Pipeline* item with a name `sample_cmake_ctest`. In *General* section set *Display Name* to `cmake_sample_ctest`, *Description* to *CMake CTest sample with docker and Jenkins integration.*  

Click to *Add source* button in *Branch Sources* section and pick *Git*. Set *Project Repository* to `https://github.com/sansajn/sample_cmake_ctest.git`, then in *Discover branches* click to *Add* and pick *Filter by name (with wildcards)* and set to `main`.

> **note**: `sample_cmake_ctest` is public repository so we do not need to set any credentials there

(Optional) In *Scan Multibranch Pipeline Triggers* section check *Periodically if not itherwise run* checkbox and set to 1 hour.

Click to *Save* button.


## Enable docker pipeline

In order to execute docker pipelines e.g.

```
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker { image 'node:16.13.1-alpine' }
    }
    stages {
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'node --version'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

install [Docker](https://plugins.jenkins.io/docker-plugin/) and [Docker Pipeline](https://plugins.jenkins.io/docker-workflow/) plugins.


## Issues

Some issues I was facing during the learning process.

- Docker host accces is not working with Jenkins user (only root)and that makes trouble in case docker builds e.g. `sample_cmake_ctest`


> Q1: Can we execute docker build from inside docker Jenkins?

No we can't, Jenkins complains with `/bin/sh: 1: docker: not found`.

> Q2: Can we use docker agent in a `Jenkinsfile` from inside a docker Jenkins?

No we can't by default.

Using docker agent from from following pipeline

```
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker { image 'node:16.13.1-alpine' }
    }
    stages {
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'node --version'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

> taken from [Using Docker with Pipeline](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/docker/) article

results to 

```
org.codehaus.groovy.control.MultipleCompilationErrorsException: startup failed:
WorkflowScript: 3: Invalid agent type "docker" specified. Must be one of [any, label, none] @ line 3, column 9.
           docker { image 'node:16.13.1-alpine' }
           ^
```

Jenkins complain.

To solve the issue install [Docker](https://plugins.jenkins.io/docker-plugin/) and [Docker Pipeline](https://plugins.jenkins.io/docker-workflow/) plugins.
